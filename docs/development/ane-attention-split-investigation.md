## Problem

The attention-boundary split in `split_at_attention_boundary()` produces
sub-programs with **invalid reshape operations** — the reshape target
shape doesn't match the input element count. This affects any model with
ops between projections and attention (per-head norms, non-standard
reshape naming), not just Qwen3.

Example from `layer_1_pre_attn`:
```mil
// matmul output: 1024 elements
tensor<fp16, [1,1024,1,1]> k_proj = matmul(x=norm_out, y=k_weight)[...];

// reshape to 128 elements — INVALID (1024 ≠ 128)
tensor<fp16, [1,128,1,1]> k_reshaped = reshape(x=k_proj, shape=...)[...];
```

The ANE compiler correctly rejects this with `ANECCompile() FAILED`.

## Root Cause

The pre_attn sub-program only contains the **K projection** and
**K-norm**, not the full Q/K/V projection set. The reshape from 1024
to 128 dims is valid in the original model because it follows a K
projection that outputs `num_kv_heads × head_dim = 8 × 128 = 1024`
— then reshapes to `[batch, seq, num_kv_heads, head_dim]` before
per-head normalization. But in the split sub-program, the reshape
target was converted to a flat `[1, 128, 1, 1]` by the ANE layout
pass, which collapses the multi-head structure into a single-head
shape.

The attention-boundary split uses **op name heuristics** (substring
matching on `_q_reshape`, `_k_reshape`, etc.) to identify the
attention cluster. This is fundamentally fragile:

- Model-internal reshapes (e.g., K-norm reshape named
  `_attn_k_norm_Reshape_1`) get caught by `_k_reshape` substring
  matching even though they are normalization ops, not attention ops.
- Models with per-head K/V norms (e.g., Qwen3's
  `SimplifiedLayerNormalization`) have reshape → norm → reshape
  sequences between projections and attention. The boundary between
  "projection ops" and "attention ops" is not separable by name alone.
- Layer 0 has no pre_attn sub-program at all — every op was
  classified as an attention cluster op and stripped entirely.
- Layers 1–28 have pre_attn sub-programs with only the K projection
  path; Q and V projections were incorrectly stripped.

## Resolution — Structural Split

Replaced the name-based heuristic with a **data-flow graph traversal**
(`a016ae6`). The implementation:

- **`OpGraph`**: directed dependency graph built from `Value::Reference`
  edges in the flat op list. Provides `walk_forward()` / `walk_backward()`
  transitive traversal.
- **Q/K/V projection detection**: groups matmul/linear ops by shared
  non-const activation input. The group of 2–3 matmuls sharing the same
  norm output are the projections. This avoids false positives from FFN
  matmuls (which have different activation inputs).
- **O-projection detection**: first matmul/linear with a const weight
  reachable forward from softmax (excluding Q/K/V projections).
- **Split classification**:
  - Pre-attn = backward walk from projections' non-const data inputs
  - Post-attn = O-projection + forward walk + exclusively-feeding consts
  - Attention cluster = everything else (stripped)
- **Fallback**: legacy name heuristic if structural detection fails
  (e.g., layers without softmax).

Verified on Qwen3-0.6B: all 29 layers produce correct pre_attn and
post_attn sub-programs. Layer 0 (previously dropped) is now included.
Per-head K/V norm reshapes correctly stay in the attention cluster.

## Additional Fixes Discovered During E2E Verification

E2E testing with `turboquant_e2e_bench` on Qwen3-0.6B revealed that
the structural split was necessary but not sufficient — the sub-programs
also failed ANE compilation due to MIL emission issues. These were fixed
in `7accb97` and `f1f7b6b`:

### 1. AneArgPromotionPass (new pass)

The ANE compiler requires `reduce_mean`/`softmax`/`layer_norm` args
(`axes`, `keep_dims`, `epsilon`) to be named const references, not
inline literal values. The ONNX converter stores these as inline
`Value::Tensor`/`Value::Bool` in attributes. The new pass:

- Promotes inline args to standalone `const` ops with `Value::Reference`
- Remaps reduce axes from `-1` (original hidden dim) to `1` (ANE
  channel dim in `[1,C,1,S]` layout)
- Fixes downstream output types in the norm chain (reduce→add→pow
  all get `[1,1,1,S]` instead of `[1,C,1,S]`)

### 2. AneLayoutPass fixes

- Removed attribute reshaping — `axes`, `keep_dims` etc. are metadata
  parameters, not activation tensors. Reshaping them corrupts semantics.
- Skip reshaping integer tensor inputs (`Value::Tensor` with int dtype)
  — these are parameter metadata (axes vectors, shape arrays).

### 3. ONNX SimplifiedLayerNormalization → decomposed RMSNorm

Changed from `sqrt` → `reciprocal` (ANE-unsupported) to the
[Orion](https://github.com/mechramc/Orion)-verified pattern:

```
mul(x, x) → reduce_mean(axes=[1]) → add(eps) → pow(-0.5) → mul(x, rrms) → mul(weight)
```

Key: uses `axis=1` (channel dim in ANE layout), `pow(x, -0.5)` (eval-
verified, max_err=0.0004), and `reduce_mean` with const ref args.

### 4. MIL text emitter fixes

- Integer const tensors (axes, shapes) emitted **inline** instead of
  BLOBFILE — ANE expects inline for small parameter tensors.
- Reduce op output type inference: collapses the reduced axis dimension
  to 1 (was incorrectly copying the input shape).

## Current Status

| Sub-program | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pre_attn` (all 29 layers) | ✅ Compiles | Structural split + RMSNorm fixes |
| `post_attn` (all layers) | ❌ Fails | `matmul` + `sigmoid` — see next steps |

### Next Steps — post_attn ANE Compilation

The `post_attn` sub-program fails ANE compilation due to two issues
unrelated to the attention split:

1. **`matmul` → `conv` conversion**: Orion uses 1×1 `conv` for linear
   layers in ANE layout `[1,C,1,S]`, not `matmul`. The existing
   `e2e_compile_and_load_conv_linear` test confirms conv works. Need
   an `AneMatmulToConvPass` that converts `matmul(x, weight_const)` to
   `conv(x, weight)` with appropriate weight reshape (`[Cin, Cout]` →
   `[Cout, Cin, 1, 1]`).

2. **`sigmoid` + `mul` → `silu` fusion**: The SiLU activation is
   decomposed as `sigmoid(x)` + `mul(x, sigmoid_out)`. The `silu` op
   is eval-verified on ANE (max_err=0.015) but `sigmoid` alone is only
   compile-verified. Need an op fusion pass or extend `OpSubstitutionPass`
   to detect and fuse the SiLU pattern.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1 — Build op dependency graph ✅

`OpGraph` struct with `forward`/`backward` adjacency lists built from
`Value::Reference` edges. Provides `walk_forward()` and `walk_backward()`
for transitive graph traversal.

**File:** `crates/ironmill-ane/src/split.rs`

### Task 2 — Identify anchor ops structurally ✅

- **Q/K/V projections**: grouped by shared non-const activation input
  (earliest group of 2+ matmul/linear ops sharing the same norm output).
- **O projection**: first matmul/linear with const weight reachable
  forward from softmax.
- **Softmax** as the attention core marker.

**File:** `crates/ironmill-ane/src/split.rs`

### Task 3 — Implement graph-based split ✅

Pre-attn = backward from projections' non-const inputs. Post-attn =
O-proj + forward + associated consts. Everything else = attention
cluster (stripped). Falls back to legacy name heuristic on failure.

**File:** `crates/ironmill-ane/src/split.rs`

### Task 4 — Tests for the structural split ✅

Five tests: standard GQA, Qwen3-like per-head norms, no-attention
fallback, layer-0 edge case, OpGraph unit test. All pass.

**File:** `crates/ironmill-ane/src/split.rs` (test module)

### Task 5 — ANE compilation fixes ✅

`AneArgPromotionPass`, `AneLayoutPass` metadata fixes, RMSNorm →
Orion-style decomposition, MIL emitter int tensor inline emission.
pre_attn compiles for all 29 Qwen3-0.6B layers.

**Files:** `crates/mil-rs/src/ir/passes/ane_arg_promotion.rs` (new),
`crates/mil-rs/src/ir/passes/ane_layout.rs`,
`crates/mil-rs/src/convert/onnx_to_mil.rs`,
`crates/mil-rs/src/convert/ir_to_mil_text.rs`

### Task 6 — E2E validation with AneInference::compile() 🔶

pre_attn compiles for all layers. post_attn blocked on matmul→conv
and SiLU fusion (see next steps above).

**File:** `crates/ironmill-ane/src/inference.rs`
